stuff I make which doesn't have a place

#revision.ps1 
a program I made for downloading past papers specifically for computer science specifically from Aberystywth, might extend it to more departments 
and universities

To use this script, simply enter your user details so the script can access the past paper resource, and then enter the module code (IN CAPITAL LETTERS), enter "Y" to add more.

The program will generate a folder called "revision" and within the folder it will generate sub-folders for each module, and in each of those folders it will create a past-paper folder to store past papers.
